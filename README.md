# Story Creation using AI
## Introduction
This project is about creating a story using AI for HR training purposes on different topics. Just give the topic and the AI will create a story for you in the form of Video with audio. 

## Technologies
- Python
- AI
- OpenCV
- MoviePy
- Genai
- gtts
- Stable Diffusion Inferance API


## How to use
To use the project, you just need to go through this website (https://storycreationusingai.streamlit.app/) and give the topic on which you want to create a story. The AI will create a story for you in the form of Video with audio.

- `huggingface_api_key.txt`: This file contains the Huggingface API key.

Last two files are not included in the repository due to security reasons.


## Working
- The user will give the topic on which he/she wants to create a story.
- The AI will create a story for the user.
- The stable diffusion model will create images for the story
- The gtts will create audio for the story.
- The MoviePy will create a video for the story.
- ffmpeg will merge the audio and video to create a final video.
- The final video will be shown to the user.
